Memory Management:

- memory allocation either happens at compile time or at run time (dynamic).
- compiler allocated memory = packaged with the binary of the program; there is
  no standard default value
- variables and arrays are allocated here (ex. float a, int b[5])

Arrays:

- must have a fixed size, cannot be set as a variable.
- there is no length function.
- there is no boundary checking.
- in C, arrays are allocated at compile time; you have to give it a explicit, 
  constant numerical size
