Writing Functions

     Function headers
         <return type> <name> (<parameters>)
     
     You must declare a function before you use it. This can be done in a few
     ways:
         1) Write the entire function at the top of your code, making sure to
	    keep the order correct
	 2) Write the function headers at the top of your code, and then
	    provide the full definition later
	 3) Put all the function headers in a separate file (ending in .h)
	    Then include that file in your .c file and provide the definitions 
	    there

     All c functions are "pass by value"
     	 A parameter is a copy of the variable passed into the function. The
	 original variable is not touched.
 Pass memory address to alter internal variable.
