Aim: Variables are the spice of life.
Do Now: What are the primitive variable types in Java?

	boolean (true/false)
	floating point numbers (i.e. double, float)
	integers (i.e. int, short, long, byte)
	char

C Primitive Variable Types:

- all C primitives are numeric
- the only difference is floating point vs. integer and size of variable
- boolean and byte aren't primitive variable types in C
- char is an integer type in C
- size can be platform dependent
	sizeof(<TYPE>) can be used to find the size in bytes
	ex. sizeof(int)

	char = 1 byte 
	int = 4 bytes
	short = 2 bytes
	long = 8 bytes
	float = 4 bytes
	double = 8 bytes
